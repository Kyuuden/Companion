# Final Fantasy Rando Companion
An auto-tracker (currently) for Free Enterprise, a Final Fantasy IV randomizer.

This is created as an external tool for BizHawk 2.10.

To install, unzip the release to BizHawk/ExternalTools/.

Free Enterprise Companion was primarily tested with either the BSNES or BSNESv115+ cores included in BizHawk 2.10. snes9X core has some issues that need to be resolved.

Please note that no assests of Final Fantasy IV are included in this software, as it reads the sprites it uses from the ROM loaded in BizHawk.
